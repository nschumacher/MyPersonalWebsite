      <p class="timeline-content-date">June 2017 - Present</p>
      <p>
        I am one of 28 recent college graduates hired into the 2017 Ascend Program. Ascend is a 90 day training program
        that teaches its members the fundamentals of the company enabling them to be effective consultants when they come
        out on the other end.
        <br/>
        Appirio is much more than just a cloud consulting company. Appirio works to enable change and growth via actionable
        strategies facilitated by cloud technologies. The company is segmented into practices based on its partnerships.
        I am a consultant in the Salesforce practice where my current role is that of a developer. I am working toward
        becoming a Salesforce Certified Technical Architect.

        I graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. My studies focused on Software Engineering. In my free time, I worked with new
        technologies trying to diversify my skillset. My interests inlcude, but are not limited to: web development, Android application development, computer security, and scripting. I enjoy attending
        Hackathons and challenging myself to develop something new in a weekend. For instance, learning a new web development technique then applying it to my personal website or another
        project I am working on. Another example being setting up a Raspberry Pi as a file server.

        I worked for the NCAA's Information Services (now IT) department as a full-stack developer while taking part in the <a href="http://xtern.me/" target="_blank">Xtern Program</a> through TechPoint. My first project was building a Ruby on Rails web
        application written in PL/SQL to house pdf document. My second project was to teach myself <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/" target="_blank">Selenium</a>, write the procedures for how the NCAA will automate their web application testing,
        and give a presentation briefing the other developers on the basics of using Selenium. My final project was a Spring Boot web application to manage and generate internal reports for
        other departments in the NCAA. Oracle was used for data storage in both web applications.
