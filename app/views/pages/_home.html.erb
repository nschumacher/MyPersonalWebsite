						I am a Computer Science major at Purdue University. My main focus is software engineering but I also have great interst in security. I like to keep myself busy with projects such as: building software to be used in RSA Security's Anti-Fraud Command Center, building Android applications with various purposes, contructing my own NFC ring for controlling my phone, and many more. <br><br>
						Whether it's building an Android application, a website, or something entirely new, I am always up for a new challenge! <br><br>
